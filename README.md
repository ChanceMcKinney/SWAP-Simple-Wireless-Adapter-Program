# interface-mode-manager |Shell & Python|
Streamlines the process of switching your wireless interface between monitor &amp; managed modes to perform wireless attacks.

Save whichever file you choose to your location of choice. Navigate to that directory (saving file to root directory eliminates this step).

# Shell script:
sudo ./modemanager.sh

# Python script:
sudo python3 modemanager.py

# Should you not have proper permissions:
sudo chmod 775 [whichever file you chose]  
  
Then run file again.
