# SWAP (Simple Wireless Adapter Program) |Shell Script|
Streamlines the process of switching your wireless interface between monitor &amp; managed modes to perform wireless attacks.

Save swap.sh to your location of choice. Navigate to that directory (saving file to root directory eliminates this step).

# To run script:
_sudo ./swap.sh_

# Should you not have proper permissions:
Navigate to directory containing script.

_sudo chmod 775 swap.sh_  
  
Then run file again.
