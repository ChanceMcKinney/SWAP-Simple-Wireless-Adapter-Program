# SWAP (Simple Wireless Adapter Program) |Shell Script|
Streamlines the process of switching your wireless interface between monitor &amp; managed modes to perform wireless attacks.

Save swap.sh to your location of choice. Navigate to that directory (saving file to root directory eliminates this step).

# To run script:
sudo ./swap.sh

# Should you not have proper permissions:
sudo chmod 775 [whichever file you chose]  
  
Then run file again.
