# SWAP (Simple Wireless Adapter Program) |Shell & Python|
Streamlines the process of switching your wireless interface between monitor &amp; managed modes to perform wireless attacks.

Save whichever file you choose to your location of choice (you can just download the whole package and delete the files you don't want). Navigate to that directory (saving file to root directory eliminates this step).

# Shell script:
sudo ./swap.sh

# Python script:
sudo python3 swap.py

# Should you not have proper permissions:
sudo chmod 775 [whichever file you chose]  
  
Then run file again.
